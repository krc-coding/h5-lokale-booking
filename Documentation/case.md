# Room Booking System

## Case:

We are looking for a team to develop a Room Booking System that will allow us to efficiently manage and monitor the usage of rooms and shared spaces across our institution. These may include classrooms, meeting rooms, labs, or event halls. The system should provide real-time booking visibility and allow different user roles (e.g., admins, teachers, and students/guests) to access the platform with permissions appropriate to their role.

We require the system to be accessible across devices, ideally as a web-based platform supported by a desktop and mobile app, and to provide instant updates across clients 

The room booking system should include as many of the following requirements:

User management:

- Profile view:
- User management view:

Rooms:

- Room management view:
- Group management view:

Bookings:

- Templates for default page design.
- Day view:
- Week view:
- Custom time duration view: 
- Bookings should have custom booking durations.
- Create booking view:
- Details view:
